# Wordmith

Wordsmith is a writing tool with modes. Each mode
will help you with 1 part of the writing process.

When you are writing you should only focus on writing. Later on you can go into Edit or Refine mode and polish your text.

The modes are:

1. Outline
2. Write
3. Edit
4. Refine
5. Publish

> **Disclaimer:**: Wordsmith is currently pre-alpha. There is an app but you might experience crashes, bugs or missing table stake features.

## License

There is currently no license because I haven't decided what to do with the project yet.
